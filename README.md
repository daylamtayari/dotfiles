# Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles, which are all of my configuration files and scripts which allow me to fully configure my environment in any system in a matter of seconds.

**DISCLAIMER: This is a constant work in progress as these are the configuration files I use on the daily and am constantly adding and modifying them.**

## Usage:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Execute the init.sh script (`chmod +x; bash init.sh`).
3. Install all of the packages in the `packages.json` file (as of right now it has to be done manually but soon to be automated).
4. Install Powerlevel 10k (soon to be automated).
5. Reinstall Packer (either via the AUR or manually, soon to be automated).
6. Execute the `install` script (`bash install`).

Many of the steps will be automated in the future.
